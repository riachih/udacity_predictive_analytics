Projects from Udacity's Predictive Analytics Nanodegree Program

## Predicting Default Risk
This project utilizes Alteryx and multiple classification models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Forest Model, and Boosted Model) to o process loan applications.

## A/B Test a New Menu Launch
This project analyzed the A/B test and write up a recommendation to whether the a restaurant chain should launch this new menu using Alteryx.

## Capstone Project
This project has three main tasks to combine what I learned in this Nanodegree Program.
Task 1: Determining Store Format
Use K-Means Model to determine the optimal number of store formats based on sales data.
Task 2: Determine the Store Format for New Stores
Develop a model that predicts which segment a store falls into based on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population that resides in the area around each new store.
Use the model to predict the best store format for each of the 10 new stores.
Task 3: Forecasting
Use Time Series Forecasting model to prepare a monthly forecast for produce sales for the full year of 2016 for both existing and new stores.
